♻️ Waste Image Classifier

This project is a deep learning–based waste classification system that identifies garbage types from uploaded images using a MobileNetV2 transfer learning model. The application allows users to upload an image, predicts the waste category (such as plastic, metal, glass, etc.), and provides region-specific disposal guidance.

The system is deployed using Streamlit and integrates Google Maps search to help users locate nearby recycling centers or appropriate dump yards based on their selected location. The goal of this project is to promote proper waste segregation and encourage sustainable waste management practices through AI-driven automation.
