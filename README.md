♻️ Waste Image Classifier

This project is an AI-based waste classification system that allows users to upload an image of garbage and automatically identifies its category (such as plastic, metal, glass, paper, etc.) using a deep learning model based on MobileNetV2 transfer learning.

After predicting the waste type, the application provides region-specific disposal instructions and redirects users to nearby recycling centers or dump yards through Google Maps integration. The goal of this project is to promote proper waste segregation and encourage environmentally responsible disposal practices using intelligent automation.
